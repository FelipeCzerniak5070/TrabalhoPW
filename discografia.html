                In The Court Of The Crimson King (com subtítulo de An
                Observation by King Crimson) é o álbum de estréia da banda de
                rock inglesa King Crimson. Foi lançado em 10 de Outubro de 1969
                pela Island Records. O álbum é um dos primeiros e mais
                influentes do rock progressivo, onde foram combinadas as
                influências musicais nas quais o rock foi fundado com elementos
                de jazz e da música clássica.

              album recorded by transitional line-ups of the group that did not
              perform live, following In the Wake of Poseidon. This is the only

              Haskell (apart from his appearance singing "Cadence and Cascade"
              on the previous album) and drummer Andy McCulloch as official
              members of the band.

              Robert Fripp, Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace. This would

              would record the trilogy of Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Starless and
              Bible Black and Red between 1973 and 1974. This is also the last
              album to feature the lyrics of co-founding member Peter Sinfield.

              percussionist Jamie Muir, and drummer Bill Bruford. It is a key

              classical music and European free improvisation as central
              influences.

              recordings.

              Red is the seventh studio album by English progressive rock band
              King Crimson. It was released on 6 October 1974 through Island
              Records in the United Kingdom and Atlantic Records in North
              America and Japan. The album was recorded at Olympic Studios in
              London in July and August 1974, and produced by the band
              themselves. The track "Providence" was a free improvisation
              recorded at their 30 June 1974 concert at the Palace Theater in
              the city of the same name. Parts of some of the pieces were
              conceived during previous improvisations performed by the band
              live. "Starless" was originally considered for their previous
              album, Starless and Bible Black (1974), but was deemed incomplete
              at the time. The lengthy version included on this album was
              refined and performed during concerts throughout 1974.

              Only band co-founder and guitarist Robert Fripp and drummer Bill

              by two American musicians: guitarist, vocalist and lyricist Adrian
              Belew and bassist and backing vocalist Tony Levin. The album
              introduced a new sound for the band, influenced by new wave,
              post-punk and world music, while retaining an experimental
              character, helping lay the groundwork for what would eventually be
              known as post-progressive rock.

              THRAK /θræk/ is the eleventh studio album by the band King Crimson
              released in 1995 through Virgin Records. It was preceded by the
              mini-album VROOOM in 1994. It is their first full-length studio
              album since Three of a Perfect Pair eleven years earlier, and the
              only full album to feature the "Double Trio" lineup of Robert
              Fripp, Adrian Belew, Tony Levin, Trey Gunn, Bill Bruford and Pat
              Mastelotto. It is also the last time all members from the
              Discipline era would work together, the last new album to feature
              Bruford (who left in 1997), and Levin.

              heightened aggression. The Power to Believe was preceded by the EP
              Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With (2002), which features
              alternate and otherwise unreleased tracks.
